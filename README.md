  ## Installation
  This application is deployed through GitHub Pages so it requires no installation. Simply navigate to the URL to use.

  ## Usage
  Upon entering the portfolio you are presented with a short about me page. Using the navigation bar on top of the page the user can navigate to pages such as Contact, Resume, and Portfolio. On the Contact page the user can send an email. Upon opening the Resume page the user is presented with a brief summary of my resume and is presented with a link to view the resume in full. On the Portfolio page you will see six of my best projects I've made throughout the bootcamp and a link to the GitHub Repo and live site for each.
